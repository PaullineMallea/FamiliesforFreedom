    <h6 id="uppercase" style="color: black;">THE ETOWAH COUNTY DETENTION CENTER AND WHY IT MATTERS</h6>    


    </div>
  </div>

     <div class="row c5 fit3">
    <div class="col-md-6">

    <p>Etowah County Detention Center (Etowah) has been repeatedly denounced by human rights advocates as one of the worst immigrant detention centers in the country.<a href="#40" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="40-ref"><sup>[1]</sup></a> It is an open secret that Etowah is ICE’s preferred location for warehousing immigrants subject to prolonged detention. Etowah is a strategic location for several reasons: its low cost to the federal government, its remote location within the jurisdiction of a federal district court and appeals court that are highly likely to side with the government and against detainees, and the infamously poor conditions within the jail, which lead many detainees to lose hope and give up on challenging their removal.</p>

    <p>Etowah is a county jail in Gadsden, Alabama run by the Etowah County Sheriff’s Department. Gadsden is a small, economically depressed city in northeastern Alabama, located about 60 miles northeast of Birmingham and 120 miles northwest of Atlanta, the closest major urban center. Etowah County has had a contract known as an intergovernmental service agreement, or IGSA, with the federal government to house immigrant detainees in the jail since 1997.<a href="#41" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="41-ref"><sup>[2]</sup></a> ICE detainees are housed in several dedicated units within the jail. Etowah currently holds approximately 300 male<a href="#42" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="42-ref"><sup>[3]</sup></a> immigrant detainees who come from all over the U.S. and were born in countries all over the world: Cameroon, Jamaica, Ethiopia, El Salvador, Kenya, Brazil, and many more. A disproportionate share of Etowah detainees are stateless or from countries where it is incredibly difficult to deport someone due to internal strife or a lack of a repatriation treaty with the U.S. Many Etowah detainees are fighting their deportation out of fear of torture or persecution in their countries of origin.</p>

    <p>For-profit, corporate-owned immigrant detention centers have garnered significant negative attention in recent years,<a href="#43" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="43-ref">[<sup>4]</sup></a> and right fully so. IGSA facilities like Etowah, however, are subject to many of the same perverse profit incentives as for-profit detention centers. Under the current contract, ICE pays the Etowah County Sheriff one of the lowest per diem rates in the country: $45 per detainee per day,<a href="#44" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="44-ref"><sup>[5</sup>]</a> compared with the average national cost of $164 per day.<a href="#45" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="45-ref"><sup>[6]</sup></a> Despite this already extremely low price, advocates and detainees have routinely complained that the Sheriff cuts corners in ways that further jeopardize the basic health and safety of both detainees and ECDC personnel, for example by feeding detainees insufficient portions and rotten food, and understaffing the detention units.<a href="#46" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="46-ref"><sup>{7]</sup></a> In fact, an obscure Alabama law permits sheriffs to personally pocket the savings on such contracts.<a href="#47" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="47-ref"><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

    <p>Etowah is located in a remote area of the country, two and a half hours from Atlanta and hundreds or thousands of miles from most detainees’ families, home communities, and legal counsel (for the few detainees that actually have counsel). This extreme isolation goes against ICE’s own policy of locating detention centers closer to metropolitan areas where detainees can access services and family visitation.<a href="#48" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="48-ref">[9]</a> There is no Legal Orientation Program at Etowah, and the vast majority of detainees do not have lawyers.<a href="#49" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="49-ref"><sup>[10]</sup></a> The sense of desolation in Etowah is further exacerbated by the fact that little or no programming is available to detainees.<a href="#50" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="50-ref"><sup>[11]</sup></a> Visitation is only permitted by video monitor for a maximum of one half hour, even when loved ones travel long distances to visit detainees. There is no privacy in the video visitation area, and monitors have malfunctioned, prohibiting visitation entirely.<a href="#51" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="51-ref"><sup>[12]</sup></a> Etowah’s isolation has been a point of repeated criticism by human rights advocates, including in a searing report by the Women’s Refugee Commission (WRC).<a href="#52" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="52-ref"><sup>[13]</sup></a> A statement by the ACLU National Prison Project to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights described Etowah as “one of the most notorious examples” of detention facilities located far from detainees’ families and legal assistance.<a href="#53" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="53-ref"><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

  </div>
      <div class="col-md-6" id="justify">


    <p>Etowah has become emblematic of many of the most damning aspects of the United States detention and incarceration system: detainees are subject to physical violence and verbal abuse, unconstitutional prolonged and indefinite detention, highly restrictive prison-like conditions, insufficient nutrition, inadequate mental health and medical care, excessive use of solitary confinement, and lack of access to in-person visitation, outdoor recreation, meaningful programming, and—because of Etowah’s extremely remote location—family and community contact, legal orientation, representation, and social services.<a href="#54" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="54-ref"><sup>[15]</sup></a> In light of Etowah’s record of systemic human rights violations, multiple civil society groups have called for its immediate<br>closure.<a href="#55" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="55-ref"><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

    <p>In fact, ICE was on the brink of terminating its contract with Etowah County in 2010. But Etowah County officials and Alabama Congressional representatives, including Sen. Richard Shelby, Rep. Mike Rogers, and Rep. Robert Aderholt (chair of Homeland Security subcommittee of House Appropriations Committee) pressured ICE to delay and then abandon its plans for Etowah’s closure. ICE announced in April 2011 it would continue detaining immigrants there.<a href="#56" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="56-ref"><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

    <p>Recently, DHS’s own internal watchdog, the Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, singled out Etowah in its annual report, noting the frequency of civil rights complaints and renewing a call for ICE to stop using the facility to house detainees.<a href="#57" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="57-ref"><sup>[18]</sup></a> Nonetheless, despite repeated complaints from detainees, human rights advocates, and even DHS itself, Etowah has passed its recent inspections with flying colors. A recent report by the National Immigrant Justice Center and Detention Watch Network on ICE’s failed inspections process highlighted Etowah as one of the most glaring examples of the disconnect between inspections ratings and the reality on the ground.<a href="#58" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="58-ref"><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

    <p>The extent of the isolation faced by detainees at Etowah cannot be understated - detainees are held far away from their families, communities and the public at large. Judges in the Northern District of Alabama are the only impartial actors who can bear witness to the plight of these detainees. What courts choose to do after habeas petitions are filed is thus of the utmost importance.</p>
