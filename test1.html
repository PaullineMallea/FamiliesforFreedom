<p><b>Ibrahim</b>, who submitted to the Court the same letter from the official at the Somali Permanent Mission to the United Nations stating that travel documents would not issued, was the <b>only one</b> of the five Somalis to be removed. ICE put Ibrahim on a plane leaving the United States before the Court reviewed his case. Because the Court does not require ICE to submit proof of travel documents or even the country to which a detainee was deported, we have no way of knowing to which country Ibrahim was deported.</p> 


<p><b>Robert</b> is a native of Togo, who cooperated fully with ICE’s attempts to secure travel documents. Presumably when it could not secure a document from Togo, ICE attempted to remove him anyway. According to his habeas corpus petition, ICE took him to a staging ground at Alexandria, Louisiana, where a Deportation Officer (DO) told him that they had no travel documents for him and so they would return him to LaSalle. Five minutes later, the same DO received a text message saying that they had secured travel documents. The next day, ICE took Robert to the Atlanta airport - he asked to see the travel documents multiple times but ICE would not allow him to until they were inside the plane. Inside the plane, they showed Robert an expired Belgian passport with which they were going to send him to Belgium. After that, he refused to comply. Robert’s relationship, if he had one at all, to Belgium was unclear. After Robert raised the incident in his habeas corpus petition in the courts ICE released him on an order of supervision.  There was never any judicial inquiry into the validity of the travel documents that ICE allegedly secured for Robert.</p>


 <p>When ICE could not secure a travel document for <b>William</b>, it brought criminal charges against him for failing to comply (failing to comply is a federal crime for which prison sentences can be imposed, but unlike regular FTC status, require actual criminal proceedings). At the time ICE had him charged with failing to comply, William already had a letter in his possession from the Embassy of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago stating: <i>“After exhaustive searches of the records held at the Immigration Division, Ministry of National Security, and the Register of Births and Deaths of the Registrar General’s Department, no record was found pertaining to the birth of William, born on July 5th, 1965 in Trinidad and Tobago neither was there any record of the issue of any travel document to anyone holding that biometric information…it will not be possible to issue a travel document in his favour.”</i> After William filed a habeas corpus petition ICE temporarily released him on an order of supervision after almost a year and a half in detention.  William was left without judicial review of the legality of his detention and without protection from being redetained for no new reason.</p>


 <p><b>Johnathan</b> expressed grave concern that the emergency travel document allegedly procured from Nigeria for him had been procured without his signature. His wife spoke to the consulate who said that in order for such a certificate to be produced, the consulate would have to speak to the detainee - something that never occurred. His habeas corpus petition was denied by the Court, who stated that <i>“[r]egardless of whether J’s signature on the travel document is a forgery, J fails to state a claim for relief under Zadvydas because he “has not provided evidence of a good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.”</i> We do not know what happened to him.</p>
