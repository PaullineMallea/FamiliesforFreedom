    <p>Without the court in the Northern District of Alabama, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a non-judicial entity, determines who  stays locked up in immigration detention at Etowah County Detention Center (Etowah) and who gets released. The internal review system for an immigrant’s detention, or Post Order Custody Review (POCR), is routine and abusive. ICE misuses the Failure to Comply status to deny the constitutional review of an immigrant’s detention. Failure to comply is defined as “refusing to comply with a request for a <strong>concrete action</strong>….”<span class="clickme" style="color: blue; font-size:18px;"><sup>[1]</sup></span><span class="footnote" style="float: left; width: 200px; margin: 20px 20px 20px 20px;">[1] Id at 18.</span> When ICE issues a failure to comply notice, they are no longer required to conduct POCR, including at the 180 day mark, where ICE is required to conduct a more rigorous inquiry.<span class="clickme" style="color: blue; font-size:18px;"><sup>[2]</sup></span><span class="footnote" style="float: left; width: 200px; margin: 20px 20px 20px 20px;">[2] DHS OIG Report, 5</span> Put simply, once a detainee has been labeled as failing to comply, ICE has the authority to detain them <strong>indefinitely</strong>. Even when ICE releases detainees on Orders of Supervision, they frequently re-detain individuals who ICE knows cannot be removed, without cause. ICE often generalizes,  an axiomatically individualized process of securing travel documents – frequently claiming that travel documents will be issued on the basis of specious assumptions. Detainee’s allegations also raise widespread concern that ICE is falsifying travel documents and attempting to remove detainees to countries with which they have no relationship.</p>

    <h3 id="uppercase" style="font-size: 18px;">ICE’s Internal Custody Review Process is An Insufficient Protection against Prolonged Detention </h3>

    <p>ICE is tasked with evaluating a person’s  detention in the context of the foreseeability of deportation to ensure that immigrants are not held indefinitely. ICE’s detention review process is called Post-Order Custody Review, or POCR.  Courts are supposed to buttress the indefinite detention of an immigrant under the Supreme Court case <i>Zadvydas</i> especially when a habeas corpus petition is filed and the concerns raised are the kinds of factual disputes that the courts should be reviewing. The absence of independent and judicial intervention has given ICE the opportunity to conduct cursory, generalized reviews without any kind of outside check.</p>

    <p>Immigrants receive a review of their detention or POCR after 90 days and 180 days of post-final order detention (and at intervals after 180 days). The criteria for 90-day POCR and 180-day POCR are different, in accordance with the Supreme Court case <i>Zadvydas</i>. The Supreme Court rendered post-final order detention unreasonable after 180 days unless the government could prove that a detainee’s removal was reasonably foreseeable, the criteria necessarily shift the greater focus on the foreseeability of removal. In theory, POCR is designed to evaluate an immigrant’s candidacy for release on an Order of Supervision.</p>

    <p>Immigrants often file the results of their custody review (called “Decision to Continue Detention”) as addenda to their habeas corpus petitions, to substantiate allegations that their detention is unjustified and that they do not have access to adequate procedural protections. If the court in the Northern District of Alabama were to look more closely at the POCR documents submitted into the record, they would find that ICE makes mistakes, such as failing to list the correct country of removal or any country at all.  The Court would also see that ICE consistently employs stock language to satisfy the regulatory requirements of 90- and 180-day POCR. In using this generic language to satisfy the POCR requirements, ICE often mischaracterizes the detainee’s criminal histories in order to cast them as dangerous and flight risks, and fabricates the likelihood of their removal. ICE frequently provides courts with misleading information about the foreseeability or the existence of travel documents. ICE uses the justification that travel documents are forthcoming, which is only appropriate at the 90 day review period, at the 180 day review. Stronger judicial oversight of habeas corpus petitions would provide a check on ICE and would help to curb some of ICE’s more concerning behaviors in the POCR process.</p>

    <div class="col-md-6" id="justify">

    <p>After detainees file habeas corpus petitions, essentially threatening ICE with judicial oversight of their actions, ICE removes many of the detainees out of Etowah. The fact that ICE takes immigrants out of Etowah who have received multiple POCR reviews only after they file habeas corpus petitions, suggests, at the very least, flaws in their POCR review process. A more pessimistic view of ICE taking detainees out of Etowah only after they have filed a habeas corpus petition is that ICE is misleading or dishonest in alleging that their deportation is foreseeable.  It is undoubtedly true that in some instances, the uncertainty of whether a detainee’s deportation was foreseeable led ICE to continue their detention. However, there are plenty of instances where detainees should have been released under POCR – where evidence abounded that travel documents would not be forthcoming, for example. Instead, immigrants were needlessly locked up for countless months. The following stories highlights just a few examples of where ICE continued detention through the POCR review but later released detainees who had brought their detention to the Court’s attention. The language of their POCR review indicates the flippancy with which ICE treats the continued detention of immigrant detainees:</p>


    <div style="margin-left: 30px;"

    <p><strong>Akele</strong> was born in an remote East African bush camp, where there was no government presence. He undoubtedly communicated this to ICE, and yet his POCR read: <i>“ICE is currently working with the government of Ethiopia to secure a travel document for your removal from the United States. A travel document from the Government of Ethiopia is expected, therefore you are to remain in ICE custody at this time.”</i> After filing a habeas corpus petition in the Northern District of Alabama, ICE came and took Akele out of Etowah.</p> 

    <p><strong>Noor</strong> had no country to claim citizenship - indeed, his deportation order made a finding of law that he was stateless. Yet, with more than 220 days in detention and three POCR reviews, ICE alleged the foreseeability of his removal and the existence of a passport that only could have been fraudulent: <i>“The DHS has submitted your name for the next charter flight to Palestine. Your removal to Palestine is imminent.” Then, 30 days later: “You have a valid passport. Your removal to Palestine is expected to occur in the reasonably foreseeable future; therefore you are to remain in ICE custody at this time.”</i> And, 30 days after that: “You have a valid passport. Your removal to Palestine is expected to occur in the reasonably foreseeable future; therefore you are to remain in ICE custody at this time.” After filing a habeas corpus petition, ICE took Noor out of Etowah. Noor’s case is a good example of how ICE’s internal custody review system fails to adequately assess the likelihood of an individual’s removal and the significant liberty interests implicated by these failures.</p> 

    <p><strong>Anputu</strong> was convicted of marijuana possession, failure to appear, and shoplifting, for which he served a total of 90 days in jail. At his 90 day-custody review, ICE said <i>“Your various arrests and/or convictions demonstrate a history of failing to follow legal and judicial orders and indicate to ICE that you are not a likely candidate for release at this time. ICE is aggressively pursuing efforts to obtain a travel document for your removal. ICE believes your removal will occur in the reasonably foreseeable future.” Later, they simply used stock language to allege the imminence of his removal: “A request for a travel document was submitted to the government of Thailand and ICE is currently working with the government of Thailand in securing a travel document for your removal from the United States. There is no reason to believe at this time that your removal will not take place within the reasonably foreseeable future.”</i> After filing a habeas corpus petition, ICE took Anputu out of Etowah.</p>

  </div>

    <div class="row" style="background: white; padding: 20px;">
    <div class="col-md-6" id="justify">

		<p>Our review of habeas corpus petitions in the Northern District of Alabama revealed ICE’s continuing abuse and misuse of the failure to comply status to prolong the detention period for immigrants who are unlikely to be removed. When ICE issues a failure to comply notice, they are no longer required to conduct POCR, including at the 180 day mark, where ICE is required to conduct a more rigorous inquiry.<span class="clickme" style="color: blue; font-size:18px;"><sup>[3]</sup></span><span class="footnote" style="float: left; width: 200px; margin: 20px 20px 20px 20px;">[3] DHS OIG Report, 5</span> Put simply, once a detainee has been labeled as failing to comply, ICE has the authority to detain them indefinitely. An internal Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of the Inspector General Report published in 2007 found that there were many cases where ICE incorrectly issues a Failure To Comply warning or issues one without sufficient evidence or adequate justification.<span class="clickme" style="color: blue; font-size:18px;"><sup>[4]</sup></span><span class="footnote" style="float: left; width: 200px; margin: 20px 20px 20px 20px;">[4] Id at 1.</span> Our review of habeas petitions filed since revealed that problems with ICE’s use of the failure to comply status persist.</p>

    <p>ICE abuses its authority and misuses the failure to comply status. The fact that when an immigrant who has filed a habeas corpus petition in the Court is taken out of Etowah after ICE issued multiple failure to comply notices provides at least some evidence that ICE does not believe the continued detention of the immigrant is constitutional.</p>

    <p>The case of William, who arrived in the United States by boat from Jamaica in the 1990s at the age of 10, illustrates ICE’s use of failure to comply status to prolong an immigrant’s confinement. William was abandoned by his mother in Jamaica and had no other stated family.  ICE believed that William was a citizen of Trinidad and Tobago. ICE claimed that William failed to provide any identification and that his only excuse for lack of documentation was his “lack of family.” In other words, despite the fact that William came to the US by boat as a ten year old child ICE blamed him for his lack of family and for the fact that he has no proof of Trinidadian identity.</p>
    
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-6" id="justify">

    <p>William spent a year and half in detention after receiving a final order of removal despite the fact that the Embassy of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago provided an official letter stating that they were not able to confirm William’s identity and therefore could not legally issue travel documents. Although ICE clearly had this information, they continued to detain William and actually filed criminal charges against William in January 2012 for failing to comply. This charge was dismissed by the District Court of New Mexico in May 2012. Despite this dismissal and a letter from the Embassy of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago denying the issuance of travel documents, ICE detained William for another five months, until he filed a habeas corpus petition. When William finally signaled his unlawful detention to the court in the Northern District of Alabama, ICE took William out of Etowah.</p>

    <p>DHS itself has recognized field officers’ misuse and abuse of the failure to comply label. The abuse of this label enables ICE to prolong the detention of individuals even in cases where ICE knows it will not be able to effectuate the immigrant’s removal. The fact that ICE takes detainees out of Etowah after they filed habeas corpus petitions is an indication of ICE”s concerns that their actions would not hold up to rigorous judicial scrutiny. However, in the absence of such scrutiny as is the case in the Northern District of Alabama, ICE is not held accountable for indefinitely detaining immigrants.</p>
