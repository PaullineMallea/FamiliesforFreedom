          <h4 style="color: yellow">Akele</h4>

          <hr>

          <p><b style="color: yellow" >Akele</b> was born in an remote East African bush camp, where there was no government presence. He undoubtedly communicated this to ICE, and yet his POCR read:<i> “ICE is currently working with the government of Ethiopia to secure a travel document for your removal from the United States. A travel document from the Government of Ethiopia is expected, therefore you are to remain in ICE custody at this time.”</i> After filing a habeas corpus petition in the Northern District of Alabama, ICE came and took Akele out of Etowah.</p>

          <h4 style="color: yellow">Noor</h4>

          <hr>

          <p><b style="color: yellow">Noor</b> had no country to claim citizenship - indeed, his deportation order made a finding of law that he was stateless. Yet, with more than 220 days in detention and three POCR reviews, ICE alleged the foreseeability of his removal and the existence of a passport that only could have been fraudulent: <i>“The DHS has submitted your name for the next charter flight to Palestine. Your removal to Palestine is imminent.” Then, 30 days later: “You have a valid passport. Your removal to Palestine is expected to occur in the reasonably foreseeable future; therefore you are to remain in ICE custody at this time.” And, 30 days after that: “You have a valid passport. Your removal to Palestine is expected to occur in the reasonably foreseeable future; therefore you are to remain in ICE custody at this time.”</i> After filing a habeas corpus petition, ICE took Noor out of Etowah. Noor’s case is a good example of how ICE’s internal custody review system fails to adequately assess the likelihood of an individual’s removal and the significant liberty interests implicated by these failures.</p>

          <h4 style="color: yellow">Anputu</h4>

          <hr>

          <p><b style="color: yellow">Anputu</b> was convicted of marijuana possession, failure to appear, and shoplifting, for which he served a total of 90 days in jail. At his 90 day-custody review, ICE said “Your various arrests and/or convictions demonstrate a history of failing to follow legal and judicial orders and indicate to ICE that you are not a likely candidate for release at this time. ICE is aggressively pursuing efforts to obtain a travel document for your removal. ICE believes your removal will occur in the reasonably foreseeable future.” Later, they simply used stock language to allege the imminence of his removal: “A request for a travel document was submitted to the government of Thailand and ICE is currently working with the government of Thailand in securing a travel document for your removal from the United States. There is no reason to believe at this time that your removal will not take place within the reasonably foreseeable future.” After filing a habeas corpus petition, ICE released Anputu on an order of supervision before the Court could hear his case leaving Anputu without a decision and subject to re-detention.</p>

          <h4 style="color: yellow">Ibrahim</h4>

          <hr>

          <p><b style="color: yellow">Ibrahim</b>, who submitted to the Court the same letter from the official at the Somali Permanent Mission to the United Nations stating that travel documents would not issued, was the <b>only one</b> of the five Somalis to be removed. ICE put Ibrahim on a plane leaving the United States before the Court reviewed his case. Because the Court does not require ICE to submit proof of travel documents or even the country to which a detainee was deported, we have no way of knowing to which country Ibrahim was deported.</p>

          <h4 style="color: yellow">Robert</h4>

          <hr>

          <p><b style="color: yellow">Robert</b> is a native of Togo, who cooperated fully with ICE’s attempts to secure travel documents. Presumably when it could not secure a document from Togo, ICE attempted to remove him anyway. According to his habeas corpus petition, ICE took him to a staging ground at Alexandria, Louisiana, where a Deportation Officer (DO) told him that they had no travel documents for him and so they would return him to LaSalle. Five minutes later, the same DO received a text message saying that they had secured travel documents. The next day, ICE took Robert to the Atlanta airport - he asked to see the travel documents multiple times but ICE would not allow him to until they were inside the plane. Inside the plane, they showed Robert an expired Belgian passport with which they were going to send him to Belgium. After that, he refused to comply. Robert’s relationship, if he had one at all, to Belgium was unclear. After Robert raised the incident in his habeas corpus petition in the courts ICE released him on an order of supervision.  There was never any judicial inquiry into the validity of the travel documents that ICE allegedly secured for Robert.</p>


          <hr>

          <h4 style="color: yellow">William</h4>

          <hr>

          <p>When ICE could not secure a travel document for <b style="color: yellow">William</b>, it brought criminal charges against him for failing to comply (failing to comply is a federal crime for which prison sentences can be imposed, but unlike regular FTC status, require actual criminal proceedings). At the time ICE had him charged with failing to comply, William already had a letter in his possession from the Embassy of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago stating: <i>“After exhaustive searches of the records held at the Immigration Division, Ministry of National Security, and the Register of Births and Deaths of the Registrar General’s Department, no record was found pertaining to the birth of William, born on July 5th, 1965 in Trinidad and Tobago neither was there any record of the issue of any travel document to anyone holding that biometric information…it will not be possible to issue a travel document in his favour.”</i> After William filed a habeas corpus petition ICE temporarily released him on an order of supervision after almost a year and a half in detention.  William was left without judicial review of the legality of his detention and without protection from being redetained for no new reason.</p>

          <h4 style="color: yellow">Johnathan</h4>

          <hr>

          <p><b style="color: yellow">Johnathan</b> expressed grave concern that the emergency travel document allegedly procured from Nigeria for him had been procured without his signature. His wife spoke to the consulate who said that in order for such a certificate to be produced, the consulate would have to speak to the detainee - something that never occurred. His habeas corpus petition was denied by the Court, who stated that <i>“[r]egardless of whether J’s signature on the travel document is a forgery, J fails to state a claim for relief under Zadvydas because he “has not provided evidence of a good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.”</i> We do not know what happened to him.</p>

    <div class="col-md-6" id="justify">

    <p>Without the Court in the Northern District of Alabama, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a non-judicial entity, determines who stays locked up in immigration detention at Etowah County Detention Center (Etowah) and who gets released. The internal review system for an immigrant’s detention, or Post Order Custody Review (POCR), is rote, highly generalized and sometimes abusive. ICE misuses the Failure to Comply status to deny the constitutional review of an immigrant’s detention. Failure to comply is defined as “refusing to comply with a request for a <strong>concrete action</strong>….”<span class="clickme" style="color: blue; font-size:18px;"><sup>[1]</sup></span><span class="footnote" style="float: left; width: 200px; margin: 20px 20px 20px 20px;">[1] Id at 18.</span> When ICE issues a failure to comply notice, they are no longer required under their regulations to conduct POCR, including at the 180 day mark, where ICE is required to conduct a more rigorous inquiry.<span class="clickme" style="color: blue; font-size:18px;"><sup>[2]</sup></span><span class="footnote" style="float: left; width: 200px; margin: 20px 20px 20px 20px;">[2] DHS OIG Report, 5</span> Put simply, once a detainee has been labeled as failing to comply, ICE claims the authority to detain them <strong>indefinitely</strong>. Even when ICE releases detainees on Orders of Supervision, they re-detain individuals who it knows cannot be removed, without cause. ICE often generalizes, an axiomatically individualized process of securing travel documents – frequently claiming that travel documents will be issued on the basis of specious assumptions. Detainee’s allegations also raise widespread concern that ICE is falsifying travel documents and attempting to remove detainees to countries with which they have no relationship.</p>
    
    <hr>

    <h3 id="uppercase" style="color: black;font-size: 18px;">ICE’s Internal Custody Review Process is An Insufficient Protection against Prolonged Detention </h3>

    <p>ICE is tasked with evaluating a person’s detention in the context of the foreseeability of deportation to ensure that immigrants are not held indefinitely. ICE’s detention review process is called Post-Order Custody Review, or POCR.  Courts are supposed to buttress the indefinite detention of an immigrant under the Supreme Court case Zadvydas especially when a habeas corpus petition is filed and the concerns raised are the kinds of factual disputes that the Courts should be reviewing. The absence of independent and judicial intervention has given ICE the opportunity to conduct cursory, generalized reviews without any kind of outside check.</p>

    <p>Immigrants receive a review of their detention or POCR after 90 days and 180 days of post-final order detention (and at intervals after 180 days). The criteria for 90-day POCR and 180-day POCR are different, in accordance with the Supreme Court case Zadvydas. The Supreme Court rendered post-final order detention unreasonable after 180 days unless the government could prove that a detainee’s removal was reasonably foreseeable, the criteria necessarily shift the greater focus on the foreseeability of removal. In theory, POCR is designed to evaluate an immigrant’s candidacy for release on an Order of Supervision.</p>

    <p>Immigrants often file the results of their custody review (called “Decision to Continue Detention”) as addenda to their habeas corpus petitions, to substantiate allegations that their detention is unjustified and that they do not have access to adequate procedural protections. If the Court in the Northern District of Alabama were to look more closely at the POCR documents submitted into the record, they would find that ICE makes mistakes, such as failing to list the correct country of removal or any country at all.  The Court would also see that ICE consistently employs stock language to satisfy the regulatory requirements of 90- and 180-day POCR. In using this generic language to satisfy the POCR requirements, ICE often mischaracterizes the detainee’s criminal histories in order to cast them as dangerous and flight risks, and fabricates the likelihood of their removal. ICE frequently provides courts with misleading information about the foreseeability or the existence of travel documents. ICE uses the justification that travel documents are forthcoming, which is only appropriate at the 90 day review period, at the 180 day review. Stronger judicial oversight of habeas corpus petitions would provide a check on ICE and would help to curb some of ICE’s more concerning behaviors in the POCR process.</p>

    
    </div>


    <div class="col-md-6" id="justify">

    <p>After detainees file habeas corpus petitions, essentially threatening ICE with judicial oversight of their actions, ICE removes or temporarily releases many of the detainees. The fact that ICE releases an individual who has received multiple POCR reviews only after they file a habeas petitions suggests that the POCR review process is inadequate. A more pessimistic view of ICE releasing detainees out of Etowah only after they have filed a habeas corpus petition and only after continuances is that ICE was misleading or dishonest in its initial claim that these detainees’ deportation was foreseeable.  It is undoubtedly true that in some instances, the uncertainty of whether a detainee’s deportation was foreseeable led ICE to continue their detention. However, there are plenty of instances where detainees should have been released under POCR – where evidence abounded that travel documents would not be forthcoming, for example. Instead, immigrants were needlessly locked up for countless months. The following stories highlight just a few examples of where ICE continued detention through the POCR review but later released detainees who had brought their detention to the Court’s attention. The language of their POCR review indicates the flippancy with which ICE treats the continued detention of immigrant detainees:</p>


    <div style="margin-left: 30px;"

    <p><strong>Akele</strong> was born in a remote East African bush camp, where there was no government presence – no towns, no hospitals and therefore no birth certificates. In his habeas petition, Akele stated “Basically, Petitioner is stateless.” He communicated this to ICE, and yet his POCR read: “ICE is currently working with the government of Ethiopia to secure a travel document for your removal from the United States. A travel document from the Government of Ethiopia is expected, therefore you are to remain in ICE custody at this time.” After filing a habeas corpus petition in the Northern District of Alabama, ICE released Akele on an order of supervision despite the fact that all of his POCRs alleged that travel documents would be forthcoming.  Akele remained vulnerable to re-detention at any moment without new cause despite the fact that ICE was unable to secure travel documents from Ethiopia after nearly a year of trying. Despite his habeas petition, he was left with no court finding on his claims.</p> 

    <p><strong>Noor</strong> had no country to claim citizenship - indeed, his deportation order made a finding of law that he was stateless. Yet, with more than 220 days in detention and three POCR reviews, ICE alleged the foreseeability of his removal and the existence of a passport that only could have been fraudulent: “The DHS has submitted your name for the next charter flight to Palestine. Your removal to Palestine is imminent.” Then, 30 days later: “You have a valid passport. Your removal to Palestine is expected to occur in the reasonably foreseeable future; therefore you are to remain in ICE custody at this time.” And, 30 days after that: “You have a valid passport. Your removal to Palestine is expected to occur in the reasonably foreseeable future; therefore you are to remain in ICE custody at this time.” After filing a habeas corpus petition, ICE released Noor on an order of supervision. Noor’s case is a good example of how ICE’s internal custody review system fails to adequately assess the likelihood of an individual’s removal and the significant liberty interests implicated by these failures. ICE’s release of Noor circumvented any judicial inquiry into the eventual foreseeability of Noor’s removal and Noor was left without protection from re-detention by ICE at any moment without new grounds despite the fact that Noor was found by an Immigration Court to be stateless.</p> 

    <p><strong>Anputu</strong> was convicted of marijuana possession, failure to appear, and shoplifting, for which he served a total of 90 days in jail. At his 90 day-custody review, ICE said “Your various arrests and/or convictions demonstrate a history of failing to follow legal and judicial orders and indicate to ICE that you are not a likely candidate for release at this time. ICE is aggressively pursuing efforts to obtain a travel document for your removal. ICE believes your removal will occur in the reasonably foreseeable future.” Later, they simply used stock language to allege the imminence of his removal: “A request for a travel document was submitted to the government of Thailand and ICE is currently working with the government of Thailand in securing a travel document for your removal from the United States. There is no reason to believe at this time that your removal will not take place within the reasonably foreseeable future.” After filing a habeas corpus petition, ICE released Anputu on an order of supervision before the Court could hear his case leaving Anputu without a decision and subject to re-detention.</p>

    <h6 style="color: black;">IMMIGRANTS ARE BEING DENIED CUSTODY REVIEW OF THEIR DETENTION BECAUSE OF ICE’s FRIVOLOUS ACCUSATIONS</h6> 
  </div>
  </div>

    <div class="row" style="background: white; padding: 0px;">
    <div class="col-md-6" id="justify">

		<p>Our review of habeas corpus petitions in the Northern District of Alabama revealed ICE’s continuing misuse of the failure to comply status to prolong the detention period for immigrants who are unlikely to be removed. When ICE issues a failure to comply notice, it is no longer required to conduct POCR, including at the 180 day mark, where ICE is required to conduct a more rigorous inquiry.<span class="clickme" style="color: blue; font-size:18px;"><sup>[3]</sup></span><span class="footnote" style="float: left; width: 200px; margin: 20px 20px 20px 20px;">[3] DHS OIG Report, 5</span> Put simply, once a detainee has been labeled as failing to comply, ICE claims the authority to detain that person <b>indefinitely</b>. An internal Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of the Inspector General Report published in 2007 found that there were many cases where ICE incorrectly issues a Failure To Comply warning or issues one without sufficient evidence or adequate justification.<span class="clickme" style="color: blue; font-size:18px;"><sup>[4]</sup></span><span class="footnote" style="float: left; width: 200px; margin: 20px 20px 20px 20px;">[4] Id at 1.</span> Our review of habeas petitions filed since revealed that problems with ICE’s use of the failure to comply status persist.</p>

    <p>ICE misuses the failure to comply status. The fact that when an immigrant who has filed a habeas corpus petition in the Court is released on an order of supervision after ICE issued multiple failure to comply notices provides at least some evidence that ICE recognizes that the continued detention of the immigrant is unconstitutional.</p>

    <p>The case of William, who arrived in the United States by boat from Jamaica in the 1990s at the age of 10, illustrates ICE’s use of failure to comply status to prolong an immigrant’s confinement. William was abandoned by his mother in Jamaica and had no other stated family.  ICE believed that William was a citizen of Trinidad and Tobago. ICE claimed that William failed to provide any identification and that his only excuse for lack of documentation was his “lack of family.” In other words, despite the fact that William came to the US by boat as a ten year old child ICE blamed him for his lack of family and for the fact that he has no proof of Trinidadian identity.</p>
    
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-6" id="justify">

    <p>William spent a year and half in detention after receiving a final order of removal despite the fact that the Embassy of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago provided an official letter stating that they were not able to confirm William’s identity and therefore could not legally issue travel documents. Although ICE clearly had this information, they continued to detain William and actually filed criminal charges against William in January 2012 for failing to comply. This charge was dismissed by the District Court of New Mexico in May 2012. Despite this dismissal and a letter from the Embassy of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago denying the issuance of travel documents, ICE detained William for another five months, until he filed a habeas corpus petition. When William finally signaled his unlawful detention to the Court in the Northern District of Alabama, ICE released William on an order of supervision.  There was no judicial scrutiny over ICE’s behavior in this case and William remains vulnerable to re-detention.</p>

    <p>DHS itself has recognized field officers’ abuse of the failure to comply label. The abuse of this label enables ICE to prolong the detention of individuals even in cases where ICE knows it will not be able to effectuate the immigrant’s removal. The fact that ICE sometimes releases immigrants they have charged with failure to comply once the  detainees  filed habeas corpus petitions is an indication of ICE”s concerns that its actions would not hold up to rigorous judicial scrutiny. However, in the absence of such scrutiny as is the case in the Northern District of Alabama, ICE is not held accountable for indefinitely detaining immigrants.</p>

    <h6 id="uppercase" style="color: black;">ICE Flouts the Supreme court by Generalizing THE Process of Securing Travel Documents</h6> 

    <p>An inherently individualized process</p> 
  </div>
  </div>

    <div class="row" style="background: white; padding: 0px;">
    <div class="col-md-6" id="justify">

    <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement uses stock language in its submissions to the Courts about the likelihood of travel documents being issued that are often dishonest or internally contradictory. In instances where filing a habeas corpus petition does not immediately result in a detainee’s removal from the United States or release on an Order of Supervision, ICE, represented by the U.S. Attorney’s office, files a response with the Court. In the 97.5% of habeas corpus petitions that claimed that travel documents were the source of their prolonged detention, the response essentially recites the facts of an immigrant’s conviction, deportation case, and custody, and lists ICE’s attempts to secure a travel document and concludes with a variation of the <u>exact same language, the overwhelming majority of the time:</u> </p>

    <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>“The Government of XYZ has not declined to issue a travel document in the Petitioner’s case. The government of XYZ has issued travel documents in the past, and there is no reason to believe that the Government of XYZ will not issue a travel document in this matter. Based upon this officer’s experience and expertise, I believe that ICE will secure a travel document for the petitioner from the Government of XYZ in the reasonably foreseeable future.”</i></p> 

  <p>On its face, the phrase is a mechanical recitation of what the Supreme Court required in their ruling on Zadvydas, in order to prolong an immigrant’s detention beyond the six month point. ICE believes that as long it claims that a detainee is removable in the ‘reasonably foreseeable future’, it is compliant with the Supreme Court ruling. However, the range of circumstances with which ICE uses this phrase suggests that the Courts should be rigorously reviewing these claims and require a greater evidentiary showing in order to continue the detention of an immigrant. Furthermore, securing travel documents is an inherently individualized process that turns on numerous factors that could take a very long time to resolve. These factors include the existence of birth records and ability to locate them and confirm their validity, embassy cooperation and sworn affidavits from family members who can attest to a detainee’s citizenship. </p>

  <p>Splitting the phrase ICE uses to justify ongoing detention into its component parts and analyzing each in the context of various types of issues raised in the Etowah habeas petitions, demonstrates that ICE’s submissions are conclusory and cannot justify ongoing detention:</p>


  <p>The first part of ICE’s generic statements on travel documents - <i>“[t]he Government of XYZ has not declined to issue a travel document in the Petitioner’s case,”</i> is merely a vague claim and in many instances, ICE is ignoring concrete individualized evidence that the embassy will not issue travel documents. ICE should not be able to use the fact that the embassy has not declined to issue documents as evidence that such documents will be forthcoming. When an embassy cannot identify a detainee as a citizen or will not issue travel documents – as is its right as a sovereign nation – detainees often secure the denial in writing. Detainees share these documents with ICE, and if they file habeas corpus petitions, often include such official letters as proof that their removal is not reasonably foreseeable. The following is an example of ICE’s disregard of such official letters:</p>

  <p>In the case of <b>five Somalis detained at Etowah</b> the petitioners included an official attestation from the Somali Permanent Mission to the United Nations stating that <i>“it is impossible to retrieve any records concerning civil status” from Somalia and that there were no “consulate services for issuing travel documents or repatriation procedures”</i>. Still, the government response to their habeas corpus petitions included the following language: “the government of Somalia has not indicated that they would not authorize a travel document for” the detainees, that their “deportation is in the very foreseeable future,” and that “there is no reason to believe that [they] will not be removed in the very foreseeable future.” When they raised this issue in the Court, ICE released four detainees and removed one to an unnamed place before the Court could inquire. ICE can and has re-detained Somalis periodically despite the fact that the Somali Permanent Mission continues to state that it cannot issue travel documents. Thus, without the court’s protection these Somali’s continue to live in fear of arbitrary, indefinite detention.</p>

  <p><b>Ibrahim</b>, who submitted to the Court the same letter from the official at the Somali Permanent Mission to the United Nations stating that travel documents would not issued, was the <b>only one</b> of the five Somalis to be removed. ICE put Ibrahim on a plane leaving the United States before the Court reviewed his case. Because the Court does not require ICE to submit proof of travel documents or even the country to which a detainee was deported, we have no way of knowing to which country Ibrahim was deported.</p> 

  <p>The second part of ICE’s generic statement is about the likelihood of securing travel documents: <i>“the Government of XYZ has issued travel documents in the past, and there is no reason to believe that the Government of XYZ will not issue a travel document in this matter,”</i> is inherently misleading. A review of habeas corpus petitions filed in the NDAL reveals that although ICE may have been able to remove some immigrants to a particular country, ICE was unable to secure travel documents for many other habeas corpus petitioners from the same country. Put another way, ICE’s historic ability to secure travel documents for some set of individuals from a particular country is not a sufficient indication of the likelihood of removal in the future or in the particular case at hand. There are any number of obstacles to a country’s ability to issue travel documents - from petitioner’s having come to the United States at such an early age, before records were digitized, to being born in rural areas where there was no government presence to issue birth certificates, to not being able to identify living family members who can substantiate an individual’s citizenship. These are highly individualized factors; for ICE to ever claim with 100% certainty that travel documents are forthcoming simply because some individuals have been deported to a specific country, as ICE regularly does with the courts, is wholly misleading.</p>

  <p>The final sentence in ICE’s stock language: <i>“Based upon this officer’s experience and expertise, I believe that ICE will secure a travel document for the petitioner from the Government of XYZ in the reasonably foreseeable future,”</i> is also misleading. Before ICE lists this stock paragraph it often recites its attempts to secure a travel document. The combination is often contradictory. Sometimes ICE will have contacted an embassy literally dozens of times, enlisted the help of the Headquarters Travel Document Unit (ICE HQTDU) and submitted formal applications to the embassy or consulate, and still have no meaningful result or response. Other times, ICE uses this generic language with respect to countries where they have not been able to secure travel documents in the past few years.  After all of that, claiming that ‘based on experience and expertise, a travel document is forthcoming’, is meaningless. If anything, officer’s experience and expertise should reveal that travel documents could be forthcoming, they could take months or years to be issued, or they could never come at all.</p>

    <p>Multiple habeas corpus petitions contained allegations by detainees that ICE was attempting to deport them with fraudulent travel documents. Because of the total lack of involvement by the Court, the validity of these allegations remains unexamined. The following allegations by detainees raise serious concerns as to the lengths that ICE will go to when a travel document is not readily available.</p>

    <p><b>Robert</b> is a native of Togo, who cooperated fully with ICE’s attempts to secure travel documents. Presumably when it could not secure a document from Togo, ICE attempted to remove him anyway. According to his habeas corpus petition, ICE took him to a staging ground at Alexandria, Louisiana, where a Deportation Officer (DO) told him that they had no travel documents for him and so they would return him to LaSalle. Five minutes later, the same DO received a text message saying that they had secured travel documents. The next day, ICE took Robert to the Atlanta airport - he asked to see the travel documents multiple times but ICE would not allow him to until they were inside the plane. Inside the plane, they showed Robert an expired Belgian passport with which they were going to send him to Belgium. After that, he refused to comply. Robert’s relationship, if he had one at all, to Belgium was unclear. After Robert raised the incident in his habeas corpus petition in the courts ICE released him on an order of supervision.  There was never any judicial inquiry into the validity of the travel documents that ICE allegedly secured for Robert.</p>


    <p>When ICE could not secure a travel document for <b>William</b>, it brought criminal charges against him for failing to comply (failing to comply is a federal crime for which prison sentences can be imposed, but unlike regular FTC status, require actual criminal proceedings). At the time ICE had him charged with failing to comply, William already had a letter in his possession from the Embassy of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago stating: <i>“After exhaustive searches of the records held at the Immigration Division, Ministry of National Security, and the Register of Births and Deaths of the Registrar General’s Department, no record was found pertaining to the birth of William, born on July 5th, 1965 in Trinidad and Tobago neither was there any record of the issue of any travel document to anyone holding that biometric information…it will not be possible to issue a travel document in his favour.”</i> After William filed a habeas corpus petition ICE temporarily released him on an order of supervision after almost a year and a half in detention.  William was left without judicial review of the legality of his detention and without protection from being redetained for no new reason.</p>

    <p><b>Johnathan</b> expressed grave concern that the emergency travel document allegedly procured from Nigeria for him had been procured without his signature. His wife spoke to the consulate who said that in order for such a certificate to be produced, the consulate would have to speak to the detainee - something that never occurred. His habeas corpus petition was denied by the Court, who stated that <i>“[r]egardless of whether J’s signature on the travel document is a forgery, J fails to state a claim for relief under Zadvydas because he “has not provided evidence of a good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.”</i> We do not know what happened to him.</p> 

    <p>In light of such allegations of fraud, one of the biggest questions remains where ICE deports people who have alleged that documents have been forged. In <i>43%</i> of the cases where ICE deported detainees, ICE fails to inform the Court of the country of removal and fails to include any form of travel document to assure the Court that detainees were able to lawfully and safely enter the receiving country. Without court involvement, we have no way of knowing how many detainees have been deported illegally.</p>
