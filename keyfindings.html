    <p>The aggregate data on habeas petitions filed by immigrants detained at Etowah Detention Center (Etowah) from 2010-2015 reveals allegations of shocking and alarming patterns of unlawful detention by Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) and deceit towards the detainees as well as the Northern District of Alabama federal court. In light of such serious allegations, every single habeas petition filed by detainees from Etowah requires robust judicial oversight. ICE’s Post-Order Custody Review (POCR) process, the only internal oversight mechanism to evaluate the lawfulness of an immigrant’s continued detention, appears to be inadequate, and often intentionally misleading. When ICE claims they are having difficulty removing individuals, they can merely label detainees as failing to comply with their deportation order which further prolongs the detention period.  Although a 2007 internal Department of Homeland Security (DHS) investigation shed light on ICE’s misconduct in applying the failing to comply label, the data from Etowah reveals that ICE continues to engage in this abusive practice.</p>

    <p>ICE routinely holds immigrants from countries to which they know they cannot be deported, even when detained immigrants provide letters from their Consulate or Embassy stating that travel documents will not be issued. What is perhaps even more suspicious is when ICE has released all immigrants from a certain country because they cannot secure travel documents except for one individual. This inconsistency, paired with allegations of fraud raises serious red flags that the Court in the Northern District of Alabama has a duty to investigate.</p>


    <p>Ultimately, careful review of hundreds of petitions raises a multitude of questions about ICE’s behavior in lieu of the Court’s oversight. These are the very questions courts should be asking and would be asking, were they to engage in the truly individualized inquiry with which they are tasked. Every question raised in every case we discuss remains unanswered and leaves hundreds more people vulnerable to indefinite and prolonged detention. This will remain true until the Northern District of Alabama takes seriously the liberty of immigrants detained at Etowah and the irreversible, devastating consequences of their detention.</p>

    <h3>Almost all (98%) of the 243 habeas corpus petitions filed between April 2010 and September 2015 analyzed in this report were outright denied or dismissed in cookie cutter opinions. As a result, there is no case law or elaboration of what a <i>Zadvydas</i> showing would require - of what would constitute a lack of reasonable foreseeability to a detainee’s removal. Immigrant detainees, 94% of whom do not have lawyers, are thus completely in the dark about how frame their habeas petitions in order to secure their freedom. Furthermore, there are no judicial decisions to protect immigrants who are released on orders of supervision from re-detention without new cause.</h3>

    <h3>The habeas corpus challenges unlawful deprivation of liberty; therefore the process is designed for expediency.

     <h4 style="text-align: left; margin-top: 60px; font-size: 25px;">Without the outside interventions of courts, ICE is completely unaccountable, free to abuse its own internal review system for evaluating detention, removing people to countries without valid entry documents, rendering them undocumented, and deporting people to countries that do not legally recognize them. When ICE skirts judicial review by releasing detainees who have filed habeas petitions, ICE prevents the detainee from having a judicial adjudication of his past claim to use as a defense and ICE has re-detained such individuals with no new cause.</h4>
