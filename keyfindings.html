    <p>The aggregate data on habeas petitions filed by immigrants detained at Etowah Detention Center (Etowah) from 2010-2015 reveals allegations of shocking and alarming patterns of Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) abuse and deceit towards the detainees as well as the Northern District of Alabama federal court. In light of such serious and consistent allegations, every single habeas petition filed by detainees from Etowah requires robust judicial oversight. ICE’s Post-Order Custody Review (POCR) process, the only internal oversight mechanism to evaluate the lawfulness of an immigrant’s continued detention, appears to be inadequate, and often intentionally misleading. When ICE claims they are having difficulty removing individuals they can merely label detainees as failing to comply with their deportation order which further prolongs the detention period.  Although even internal Department of Homeland Security (DHS) investigations have shed light on ICE’s misconduct in applying the failing to comply label, the data in Etowah reveals rampant abuses.</p>

    <p> ICE routinely holds immigrants from countries to which they know they cannot be deported to, even when detained immigrants provide letters from their Consulate or Embassy stating that travel documents will not be issued. What is perhaps even more suspicious is when ICE has released all immigrants from a certain country because they cannot secure travel documents except for one individual. This inconsistency, or seemingly arbitrary pattern of removal, paired with allegations of fraud raises serious red flags that the court in the Northern District of Alabama has a constitutional duty to investigate.</p>


    <p >Ultimately, careful review of hundreds of petitions raises a multitude of questions about ICE’s behavior in lieu of the court’s oversight. These are the very questions courts should be asking and would be asking, were they to engage in the truly individualized inquiry with which they are tasked. Every question raised in every case we have discussed remain unanswered and leave hundreds more people vulnerable to indefinite and prolonged detention. This will remain true until the Northern District of Alabama takes seriously the liberty of immigrants detained at Etowah and the irreversible, devastating consequences of their detention.</p>
