 -->

<p>Families for Freedom started receiving an increase in phone calls and messages from detainees in Etowah County Detention Center (Etowah) in Gadsden, Alabama. Immigrants detained at Etowah file their habeas corpus petitions with the Northern District of Alabama courthouse in Birmingham, Alabama. They do so to draw courts’ attention to the profound loss of liberty they are facing. The number of detainees asking specifically about habeas corpus petitions and problems with their travel documents began to rise, and so Families for Freedom and the Immigrant Rights Clinic at New York University School of Law partnered up to investigate.</p>

<p>The writ of habeas corpus lies at the heart of society’s protection against the illegal deprivation of liberty by the government. Habeas corpus enables individuals to rattle their cages - to call on judges to use their power to provide a remedy if there is no lawful basis for detention.<a href="#2" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="2-ref"><sup>[1]</sup></a> The writ also exists to “continually [check] executive authority to imprison without process.”<a href="#3" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="3-ref"><sup>[2]</sup></a> From at least the seventeenth century onwards, judges have played a central role in protecting individuals from unlawful detention by the state. As the concept of habeas evolved, it merged with the idea of due process to form a “powerful current in the stream of constitutionalism.<a href="#4" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="4-ref"><sup>[3]</sup></a> The writ was most famously used in 1772 by Lord Mansfield to liberate a Jamaican slave who was forcibly brought to the United Kingdom, paving a legal path to the abolition of slavery.<a href="#5" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="5-ref"><sup>[4]</sup></a> In Number 83 of the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton framed the writ as a remedy for “arbitrary punishments” and “judicial despotism.”<a href="#6" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="6-ref"><sup>[5]</sup></a>

<br>
<br>

The Judiciary Act of 1789 authorizes federal courts in the United States to grant a writ of habeas corpus for detainees who are held “in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States."<a href="#7" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="7-ref"><sup>[5]</sup></a> The Judiciary Act grants this power for detainees regardless of their immigration status.<a href="#8" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="8-ref"><sup>[6]</sup></a>

<br>
<br>


The U.S. law (28 U.S.C. §2243) that outlines the procedure for filing and adjudicating habeas petitions acknowledges the grave liberty interests at stake. Once a habeas petition has been filed, the court must issue an order requiring the person who has custody over the detainee to provide a “true cause of the detention.”<a href="#9" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="9-ref"><sup>[7]</sup></a> The response must be filed within three days. If good cause is shown, the court can grant an extension of up to 20 days.  The maximum amount of time the person responsible for the person in custody has to respond is 23 days. After receiving the response, the court is required to schedule a hearing. Unless the habeas petition and response raise only purely legal questions, the detainee has the <strong>right</strong> to be brought before the judge to make his or her case.</p>


<p>For immigrant detainees the habeas corpus petition is crucial. Immigration detention was once the exception. Immigration violations are civil, not criminal offenses, and enforcement corresponded accordingly. As the War on Drugs and mass incarceration took hold in the political consciousness of the 1980’s and 1990’s however, incarceration became not only a primary instrument of criminal law enforcement, but immigration law enforcement as well. Congress has authorized mandatory detention of immigrants with certain criminal convictions before they receive a final order of removal and has made the detention of immigrants with final orders of removal mandatory for a short period of time in order to effectuate their removal. This report focuses on immigrants detained at Etowah who have already been ordered removed and have been languishing indefinitely in immigration detention pending their removal.</p>

<p>The deprivation of liberty that detention precipitates cannot be underestimated. The only legal instrument truly available to immigrant detainees who are awaiting removal to another country, is one specific kind of legal petition that is at the core of this report:<strong> the writ of habeas corpus.</strong></p>
