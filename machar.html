    <p><b>Machar</b> was born in South Sudan in 1968 and came to the US as a refugee in 2001. He has a wife and six children who are all either Legal Permanent Residents or U.S. Citizens. Machar first entered ICE detention in July 2007, but was released on an order of supervision in May 2008. In June 2013, he was unexpectedly re-detained. At the time of filing his habeas corpus petition, Machar had already been detained in Etowah for <b>almost a whole year</b>. ICE’s argument for continuing to detain Machar was based on his convictions prior to 2007 when he was first detained, and therefore was considered a danger to the community. However, ICE had previously released him indicating that despite the prior convictions they had not found him to be a danger to the community. ICE acknowledged that Machar was a citizen and native of <b>South Sudan</b> and they discussed attempts to secure documents from the Consulate of South Sudan in Washington D.C.  In their final review dated January 16, 2015, ICE stated that they were working with the government of <b>Sudan</b> to secure travel documents for his removal. Machar expressed fear and concerns about being deported to Sudan, a country that he is not from and that has been in armed conflict with South Sudan. The Court never ordered a hearing and failed to acknowledge these fears about being deported to the wrong country. The Court also did not require ICE to provide any more details about the process of securing travel documents from South Sudan. After holding Machar in post-final order detention for a second time for <b>fourteen months</b>, ICE released him on an order of supervision. ICE then moved to dismiss Machar’s habeas petition as moot, thereby circumventing judicial inquiry into whether ICE was attempting to deport Machar to the wrong country.</p>
