          <h4 style="color: yellow">Akele</h4>

          <hr>

          <p><b style="color: yellow" >Akele</b> was born in an remote East African bush camp, where there was no government presence. He undoubtedly communicated this to ICE, and yet his POCR read:<i> “ICE is currently working with the government of Ethiopia to secure a travel document for your removal from the United States. A travel document from the Government of Ethiopia is expected, therefore you are to remain in ICE custody at this time.”</i> After filing a habeas corpus petition in the Northern District of Alabama, ICE came and took Akele out of Etowah.</p> 

          <hr>

          <h4 style="color: yellow">Noor</h4>

          <hr>

          <p><b style="color: yellow">Noor</b> had no country to claim citizenship - indeed, his deportation order made a finding of law that he was stateless. Yet, with more than 220 days in detention and three POCR reviews, ICE alleged the foreseeability of his removal and the existence of a passport that only could have been fraudulent: <i>“The DHS has submitted your name for the next charter flight to Palestine. Your removal to Palestine is imminent.” Then, 30 days later: “You have a valid passport. Your removal to Palestine is expected to occur in the reasonably foreseeable future; therefore you are to remain in ICE custody at this time.” And, 30 days after that: “You have a valid passport. Your removal to Palestine is expected to occur in the reasonably foreseeable future; therefore you are to remain in ICE custody at this time.”</i> After filing a habeas corpus petition, ICE took Noor out of Etowah. Noor’s case is a good example of how ICE’s internal custody review system fails to adequately assess the likelihood of an individual’s removal and the significant liberty interests implicated by these failures.</p>
 


          <hr>

          <h4 style="color: yellow">Anputu</h4>

          <hr>

          <p><b style="color: yellow">Anputu</b> was convicted of marijuana possession, failure to appear, and shoplifting, for which he served a total of 90 days in jail. At his 90 day-custody review, ICE said “Your various arrests and/or convictions demonstrate a history of failing to follow legal and judicial orders and indicate to ICE that you are not a likely candidate for release at this time. ICE is aggressively pursuing efforts to obtain a travel document for your removal. ICE believes your removal will occur in the reasonably foreseeable future.” Later, they simply used stock language to allege the imminence of his removal: “A request for a travel document was submitted to the government of Thailand and ICE is currently working with the government of Thailand in securing a travel document for your removal from the United States. There is no reason to believe at this time that your removal will not take place within the reasonably foreseeable future.” After filing a habeas corpus petition, ICE released Anputu on an order of supervision before the Court could hear his case leaving Anputu without a decision and subject to re-detention.</p>

          <hr>

          <h4 style="color: yellow">Ibrahim</h4>

          <hr>

          <p><b style="color: yellow">Ibrahim</b>, who submitted to the Court the same letter from the official at the Somali Permanent Mission to the United Nations stating that travel documents would not issued, was the <b>only one</b> of the five Somalis to be removed. ICE put Ibrahim on a plane leaving the United States before the Court reviewed his case. Because the Court does not require ICE to submit proof of travel documents or even the country to which a detainee was deported, we have no way of knowing to which country Ibrahim was deported.</p>

          <h4 style="color: yellow">Robert</h4>

          <hr>

          <p><b style="color: yellow">Robert</b> is a native of Togo, who cooperated fully with ICE’s attempts to secure travel documents. Presumably when it could not secure a document from Togo, ICE attempted to remove him anyway. According to his habeas corpus petition, ICE took him to a staging ground at Alexandria, Louisiana, where a Deportation Officer (DO) told him that they had no travel documents for him and so they would return him to LaSalle. Five minutes later, the same DO received a text message saying that they had secured travel documents. The next day, ICE took Robert to the Atlanta airport - he asked to see the travel documents multiple times but ICE would not allow him to until they were inside the plane. Inside the plane, they showed Robert an expired Belgian passport with which they were going to send him to Belgium. After that, he refused to comply. Robert’s relationship, if he had one at all, to Belgium was unclear. After Robert raised the incident in his habeas corpus petition in the courts ICE released him on an order of supervision.  There was never any judicial inquiry into the validity of the travel documents that ICE allegedly secured for Robert.</p>


          <hr>

          <h4 style="color: yellow">William</h4>

          <hr>

          <p>When ICE could not secure a travel document for <b style="color: yellow">William</b>, it brought criminal charges against him for failing to comply (failing to comply is a federal crime for which prison sentences can be imposed, but unlike regular FTC status, require actual criminal proceedings). At the time ICE had him charged with failing to comply, William already had a letter in his possession from the Embassy of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago stating: <i>“After exhaustive searches of the records held at the Immigration Division, Ministry of National Security, and the Register of Births and Deaths of the Registrar General’s Department, no record was found pertaining to the birth of William, born on July 5th, 1965 in Trinidad and Tobago neither was there any record of the issue of any travel document to anyone holding that biometric information…it will not be possible to issue a travel document in his favour.”</i> After William filed a habeas corpus petition ICE temporarily released him on an order of supervision after almost a year and a half in detention.  William was left without judicial review of the legality of his detention and without protection from being redetained for no new reason.</p>


          <hr>

          <h4 style="color: yellow">Johnathan</h4>

          <hr>

          <p><b style="color: yellow">Johnathan</b> expressed grave concern that the emergency travel document allegedly procured from Nigeria for him had been procured without his signature. His wife spoke to the consulate who said that in order for such a certificate to be produced, the consulate would have to speak to the detainee - something that never occurred. His habeas corpus petition was denied by the Court, who stated that <i>“[r]egardless of whether J’s signature on the travel document is a forgery, J fails to state a claim for relief under Zadvydas because he “has not provided evidence of a good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.”</i> We do not know what happened to him.</p>

    <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement uses stock language in its submissions to the Courts about the likelihood of travel documents being issued that are often dishonest or internally contradictory. In instances where filing a habeas corpus petition does not immediately result in a detainee’s removal from the United States or release on an Order of Supervision, ICE, represented by the U.S. Attorney’s office, files a response with the Court. In the 97.5% of habeas corpus petitions that claimed that travel documents were the source of their prolonged detention, the response essentially recites the facts of an immigrant’s conviction, deportation case, and custody, and lists ICE’s attempts to secure a travel document and concludes with a variation of the <u>exact same language, the overwhelming majority of the time:</u> </p>

    <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><i>“The Government of XYZ has not declined to issue a travel document in the Petitioner’s case. The government of XYZ has issued travel documents in the past, and there is no reason to believe that the Government of XYZ will not issue a travel document in this matter. Based upon this officer’s experience and expertise, I believe that ICE will secure a travel document for the petitioner from the Government of XYZ in the reasonably foreseeable future.”</i></p> 

  <p>On its face, the phrase is a mechanical recitation of what the Supreme Court required in their ruling on Zadvydas, in order to prolong an immigrant’s detention beyond the six month point. ICE believes that as long it claims that a detainee is removable in the ‘reasonably foreseeable future’, it is compliant with the Supreme Court ruling. However, the range of circumstances with which ICE uses this phrase suggests that the Courts should be rigorously reviewing these claims and require a greater evidentiary showing in order to continue the detention of an immigrant. Furthermore, securing travel documents is an inherently individualized process that turns on numerous factors that could take a very long time to resolve. These factors include the existence of birth records and ability to locate them and confirm their validity, embassy cooperation and sworn affidavits from family members who can attest to a detainee’s citizenship. </p>

  <p>Splitting the phrase ICE uses to justify ongoing detention into its component parts and analyzing each in the context of various types of issues raised in the Etowah habeas petitions, demonstrates that ICE’s submissions are conclusory and cannot justify ongoing detention:</p>


  <p>The first part of ICE’s generic statements on travel documents - <i>“[t]he Government of XYZ has not declined to issue a travel document in the Petitioner’s case,”</i> is merely a vague claim and in many instances, ICE is ignoring concrete individualized evidence that the embassy will not issue travel documents. ICE should not be able to use the fact that the embassy has not declined to issue documents as evidence that such documents will be forthcoming. When an embassy cannot identify a detainee as a citizen or will not issue travel documents – as is its right as a sovereign nation – detainees often secure the denial in writing. Detainees share these documents with ICE, and if they file habeas corpus petitions, often include such official letters as proof that their removal is not reasonably foreseeable. The following is an example of ICE’s disregard of such official letters:</p>

  <p>In the case of <b>five Somalis detained at Etowah</b> the petitioners included an official attestation from the Somali Permanent Mission to the United Nations stating that <i>“it is impossible to retrieve any records concerning civil status” from Somalia and that there were no “consulate services for issuing travel documents or repatriation procedures”</i>. Still, the government response to their habeas corpus petitions included the following language: “the government of Somalia has not indicated that they would not authorize a travel document for” the detainees, that their “deportation is in the very foreseeable future,” and that “there is no reason to believe that [they] will not be removed in the very foreseeable future.” When they raised this issue in the Court, ICE released four detainees and removed one to an unnamed place before the Court could inquire. ICE can and has re-detained Somalis periodically despite the fact that the Somali Permanent Mission continues to state that it cannot issue travel documents. Thus, without the court’s protection these Somali’s continue to live in fear of arbitrary, indefinite detention.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6" id="justify">

  <p><b>Ibrahim</b>, who submitted to the Court the same letter from the official at the Somali Permanent Mission to the United Nations stating that travel documents would not issued, was the <b>only one</b> of the five Somalis to be removed. ICE put Ibrahim on a plane leaving the United States before the Court reviewed his case. Because the Court does not require ICE to submit proof of travel documents or even the country to which a detainee was deported, we have no way of knowing to which country Ibrahim was deported.</p> 

  <p>The second part of ICE’s generic statement is about the likelihood of securing travel documents: <i>“the Government of XYZ has issued travel documents in the past, and there is no reason to believe that the Government of XYZ will not issue a travel document in this matter,”</i> is inherently misleading. A review of habeas corpus petitions filed in the NDAL reveals that although ICE may have been able to remove some immigrants to a particular country, ICE was unable to secure travel documents for many other habeas corpus petitioners from the same country. Put another way, ICE’s historic ability to secure travel documents for some set of individuals from a particular country is not a sufficient indication of the likelihood of removal in the future or in the particular case at hand. There are any number of obstacles to a country’s ability to issue travel documents - from petitioner’s having come to the United States at such an early age, before records were digitized, to being born in rural areas where there was no government presence to issue birth certificates, to not being able to identify living family members who can substantiate an individual’s citizenship. These are highly individualized factors; for ICE to ever claim with 100% certainty that travel documents are forthcoming simply because some individuals have been deported to a specific country, as ICE regularly does with the courts, is wholly misleading.</p>

  <p>The final sentence in ICE’s stock language: <i>“Based upon this officer’s experience and expertise, I believe that ICE will secure a travel document for the petitioner from the Government of XYZ in the reasonably foreseeable future,”</i> is also misleading. Before ICE lists this stock paragraph it often recites its attempts to secure a travel document. The combination is often contradictory. Sometimes ICE will have contacted an embassy literally dozens of times, enlisted the help of the Headquarters Travel Document Unit (ICE HQTDU) and submitted formal applications to the embassy or consulate, and still have no meaningful result or response. Other times, ICE uses this generic language with respect to countries where they have not been able to secure travel documents in the past few years.  After all of that, claiming that ‘based on experience and expertise, a travel document is forthcoming’, is meaningless. If anything, officer’s experience and expertise should reveal that travel documents could be forthcoming, they could take months or years to be issued, or they could never come at all.</p>

    <p>Multiple habeas corpus petitions contained allegations by detainees that ICE was attempting to deport them with fraudulent travel documents. Because of the total lack of involvement by the Court, the validity of these allegations remains unexamined. The following allegations by detainees raise serious concerns as to the lengths that ICE will go to when a travel document is not readily available.</p>

    <p><b>Robert</b> is a native of Togo, who cooperated fully with ICE’s attempts to secure travel documents. Presumably when it could not secure a document from Togo, ICE attempted to remove him anyway. According to his habeas corpus petition, ICE took him to a staging ground at Alexandria, Louisiana, where a Deportation Officer (DO) told him that they had no travel documents for him and so they would return him to LaSalle. Five minutes later, the same DO received a text message saying that they had secured travel documents. The next day, ICE took Robert to the Atlanta airport - he asked to see the travel documents multiple times but ICE would not allow him to until they were inside the plane. Inside the plane, they showed Robert an expired Belgian passport with which they were going to send him to Belgium. After that, he refused to comply. Robert’s relationship, if he had one at all, to Belgium was unclear. After Robert raised the incident in his habeas corpus petition in the courts ICE released him on an order of supervision.  There was never any judicial inquiry into the validity of the travel documents that ICE allegedly secured for Robert.</p>


    <p>When ICE could not secure a travel document for <b>William</b>, it brought criminal charges against him for failing to comply (failing to comply is a federal crime for which prison sentences can be imposed, but unlike regular FTC status, require actual criminal proceedings). At the time ICE had him charged with failing to comply, William already had a letter in his possession from the Embassy of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago stating: <i>“After exhaustive searches of the records held at the Immigration Division, Ministry of National Security, and the Register of Births and Deaths of the Registrar General’s Department, no record was found pertaining to the birth of William, born on July 5th, 1965 in Trinidad and Tobago neither was there any record of the issue of any travel document to anyone holding that biometric information…it will not be possible to issue a travel document in his favour.”</i> After William filed a habeas corpus petition ICE temporarily released him on an order of supervision after almost a year and a half in detention.  William was left without judicial review of the legality of his detention and without protection from being redetained for no new reason.</p>

    <p><b>Johnathan</b> expressed grave concern that the emergency travel document allegedly procured from Nigeria for him had been procured without his signature.

    <p>In light of such allegations of fraud, one of the biggest questions remains where ICE deports people who have alleged that documents have been forged. In <i>43%</i> of the cases where ICE deported detainees, ICE fails to inform the Court of the country of removal and fails to include any form of travel document to assure the Court that detainees were able to lawfully and safely enter the receiving country. Without court involvement, we have no way of knowing how many detainees have been deported illegally.</p>
