    <div class="col-md-6" id="justify">

    <p>The defining characteristic of detention in civil immigration facilities is a profound loss of liberty. Immigrants are locked up, unable to enjoy basic freedoms and incapable of accessing their families and communities. Unlike individuals detained under the criminal system who often have specific sentences – with a start and end date - there is no definitive end for detained immigrants. There are so many variables in the removal process and so few procedural protections to ensure that detainees have some sense of the duration of their detention. While civil detention is allegedly non-punitive and administrative in nature, and criminal incarceration is rehabilitative and punitive, even a general look at the reality of immigration detention renders the distinction meaningless. .</p>

     <p> Beyond the sheer trauma of being detained pending deportation, isolated from family, friends and community, immigrants and their loved ones have no certainty over when they might be free from detention. Detention has fear reaching consequences on immigrant families and their communities. Below are stories about immigrants’ equities and how families are being impacted by detention.</p>

     <p><strong>Jose</strong> wrote in his habeas corpus petition that while he was detained, his nine year old U.S. citizen daughter “was inappropriately touched” by a friend of the family. The incident was reported to the police, criminal charges have been brought against the perpetrator of the offense, and the child is undergoing therapy. The little girl has been crying, acting out, and telling the therapist, <i>“My daddy is in jail but this bad man is not in jail.”</i> The continued detention of Jose is causing tremendous psychological harm to him and his young daughter, especially after her abuse. He is needed at home by his family and his daughter to provide her with a source of comfort and strength through this ordeal.</p>

    <h6 style="color: black;">IMMIGRANTS ARE BEING DENIED CUSTODY REVIEW OF THEIR DETENTION BECAUSE OF ICE’s FRIVOLOUS ACCUSATIONS</h6> 
  </div>
  </div>

    <div class="row" style="background: white; padding: 0px;">
    <div class="col-md-6" id="justify">

    <p>Our review of habeas corpus petitions in the Northern District of Alabama revealed ICE’s continuing misuse of the failure to comply status to prolong the detention period for immigrants who are unlikely to be removed. When ICE issues a failure to comply notice, it is no longer required to conduct POCR, including at the 180 day mark, where ICE is required to conduct a more rigorous inquiry.<span class="clickme" style="color: blue; font-size:18px;"><sup>[3]</sup></span><span class="footnote" style="float: left; width: 200px; margin: 20px 20px 20px 20px;">[3] DHS OIG Report, 5</span> Put simply, once a detainee has been labeled as failing to comply, ICE claims the authority to detain that person <b>indefinitely</b>. An internal Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Office of the Inspector General Report published in 2007 found that there were many cases where ICE incorrectly issues a Failure To Comply warning or issues one without sufficient evidence or adequate justification.<span class="clickme" style="color: blue; font-size:18px;"><sup>[4]</sup></span><span class="footnote" style="float: left; width: 200px; margin: 20px 20px 20px 20px;">[4] Id at 1.</span> Our review of habeas petitions filed since revealed that problems with ICE’s use of the failure to comply status persist.</p>

    <p>ICE misuses the failure to comply status. The fact that when an immigrant who has filed a habeas corpus petition in the Court is released on an order of supervision after ICE issued multiple failure to comply notices provides at least some evidence that ICE recognizes that the continued detention of the immigrant is unconstitutional.</p>

    <p>The case of William, who arrived in the United States by boat from Jamaica in the 1990s at the age of 10, illustrates ICE’s use of failure to comply status to prolong an immigrant’s confinement. William was abandoned by his mother in Jamaica and had no other stated family.  ICE believed that William was a citizen of Trinidad and Tobago. ICE claimed that William failed to provide any identification and that his only excuse for lack of documentation was his “lack of family.” In other words, despite the fact that William came to the US by boat as a ten year old child ICE blamed him for his lack of family and for the fact that he has no proof of Trinidadian identity.</p>
    
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-6" id="justify">

    <p>William spent a year and half in detention after receiving a final order of removal despite the fact that the Embassy of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago provided an official letter stating that they were not able to confirm William’s identity and therefore could not legally issue travel documents. Although ICE clearly had this information, they continued to detain William and actually filed criminal charges against William in January 2012 for failing to comply. This charge was dismissed by the District Court of New Mexico in May 2012. Despite this dismissal and a letter from the Embassy of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago denying the issuance of travel documents, ICE detained William for another five months, until he filed a habeas corpus petition. When William finally signaled his unlawful detention to the Court in the Northern District of Alabama, ICE released William on an order of supervision.  There was no judicial scrutiny over ICE’s behavior in this case and William remains vulnerable to re-detention.</p>

    <p>DHS itself has recognized field officers’ abuse of the failure to comply label. The abuse of this label enables ICE to prolong the detention of individuals even in cases where ICE knows it will not be able to effectuate the immigrant’s removal. The fact that ICE sometimes releases immigrants they have charged with failure to comply once the  detainees  filed habeas corpus petitions is an indication of ICE”s concerns that its actions would not hold up to rigorous judicial scrutiny. However, in the absence of such scrutiny as is the case in the Northern District of Alabama, ICE is not held accountable for indefinitely detaining immigrants.</p>
