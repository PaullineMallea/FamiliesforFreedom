          <p><b style="color: yellow" >Cesar</b>arrived in the United States in November of 2012 as an asylum seeker from Eritrea. After his application for asylum was denied, he was detained by ICE. Cesar had no criminal convictions and had never served any time in prison. In Cesar’s habeas corpus petition, he contested ICE’s allegations that he was failing to comply by detailing his personal attempts to secure a travel document from the Eritrean consulate, by making phone calls and supplying ICE with all of his documents. His habeas corpus petition alleges that the Consulate informed him on April 15th, 2014 that they did not recognize him as a citizen of Eritrea, and that they would not issue a travel document. His habeas corpus petition further alleges that ICE informed him that the El Salvadorian consulate would take care of his travel documents. Cesar states clearly in his habeas corpus petition that he is obviously not from El Salvador and should not be deported to that country. Twenty-two days after Mr. Cesar filed his habeas corpus petition, the Court ordered the ICE to respond within twenty days. It did not order any specific response in relation to the allegations about ICE securing travel documents and the removal attempts to El Salvador. Nine days before a response was due, ICE requested an extension of time, which the Court granted on the same day. Sixteen days later ICE released Cesar on an order of supervision after a year and a half in detention, completely circumventing judicial review. The Court never made findings on whether or not ICE was attempting to remove Cesar to El Salvador. Cesar was denied his right to present his case in Court, remained vulnerable to re-detention at any moment and remained vulnerable to deportation to a country to which he has no connection.</p>

          <h4 style="color: yellow">Machar</h4>

          <hr>

          <p><b style="color: yellow">Machar</b>was born in South Sudan in 1968 and came to the US as a refugee in 2001. He has a wife and six children who are all either Legal Permanent Residents or U.S. Citizens. Machar first entered ICE detention in July 2007, but was released on an order of supervision in May 2008. In June 2013, he was unexpectedly re-detained. At the time of filing his habeas corpus petition, Machar had already been detained in Etowah for <b>almost a whole year</b>. ICE’s argument for continuing to detain Machar was based on his convictions prior to 2007 when he was first detained, and therefore was considered a danger to the community. However, ICE had previously released him indicating that despite the prior convictions they had not found him to be a danger to the community. ICE acknowledged that Machar was a citizen and native of <b>South Sudan</b> and they discussed attempts to secure documents from the Consulate of South Sudan in Washington D.C.  In their final review dated January 16, 2015, ICE stated that they were working with the government of <b>Sudan</b> to secure travel documents for his removal. Machar expressed fear and concerns about being deported to Sudan, a country that he is not from and that has been in armed conflict with South Sudan. The Court never ordered a hearing and failed to acknowledge these fears about being deported to the wrong country. The Court also did not require ICE to provide any more details about the process of securing travel documents from South Sudan. After holding Machar in post-final order detention for a second time for <b>fourteen months</b>, ICE released him on an order of supervision. ICE then moved to dismiss Machar’s habeas petition as moot, thereby circumventing judicial inquiry into whether ICE was attempting to deport Machar to the wrong country.</p>

    <h6 style="color: black;">THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES REQUIRES LIMITS</h6> 
    <h3 style="color: black;">to how long a person can be detained after they have been ordered deported</h3>

  </div>

    <div class="row c5" style="background: #f7f8f9;">
    <div class="col-md-6" style="padding-top: 20px;">

    <p>Fifteen years ago the Supreme Court of the United States - the highest court in the country - reminded federal courts of their constitutional duty to protect the liberty of detained immigrants.<a href="#9" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="9-ref"><sup>[1]</sup></a> In 1996, Congress had amended the immigration laws to increase the use of immigration detention to hold immigrants who had been ordered deported while their removal was pending.<a href="#10" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="10-ref"><sup>[2]</sup></a> The consequences of the rise of incarceration for immigrants were extreme – detainees were deprived of their liberty, detained far from their families and communities, and held in many cases indefinitely while the government attempted to secure an entry document for their deportation to another country. The Supreme Court responded on June 28th, 2001, in <i>Zadvydas v. Davis</i> – urging courts not to “[abdicate] their legal responsibility,” and providing courts with vital criteria through which to judge the detention of immigrants while the government is in theory attempting to secure documents for a detainee’s entry into the receiving country. The release of this report marks the 15th anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling and chronicles its legacy, in one detention center in particular; Etowah County Detention Center in Gadsden, Alabama.</p>


    <p>In <i>Zadvydas</i>, the Supreme Court recognized that detainees awaiting deportation were disappearing into a legal black hole and that habeas petitions provided the only path out. Prior to the Supreme Court decision, indefinite detention was routine.<a href="#11" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="11-ref"><sup>[3]</sup></a> In response to the significant constitutional questions raised by the possibility of indefinite detention, the Supreme Court reminded courts of their duty to take seriously the habeas petitions of detainees who had been ordered deported. The Court instructed federal courts to ask whether a detainee’s removal was not reasonably foreseeable, and therefore, indefinite. This question of reasonable foreseeability is precisely the kind of factual issue that federal courts are supposed to investigate. The Supreme Court understood that federal courts take into account the immigration-related expertise of immigration enforcement agencies when determining the reasonable foreseeability of deportation, but warned courts not to abdicate their independent legal responsibility to review the lawfulness of an immigrant’s detention.</p>



    </div>


    <div class="col-md-6" style="padding-top: 20px;">

    <p>Before the Supreme Court got involved, the government already had 90 days to remove an immigrant who was detained. The Supreme Court, recognizing that securing an entry document for detainees often took longer (for reasons discussed below), gave the government another 90 days before the detention would become ‘presumptively unreasonable.’ After 180 days, in other words, an immigrant could file a habeas petition challenging his or her continued detention, and the <i>government</i> would bear the burden of proving that the immigrant’s removal was reasonably foreseeable. If a judge was satisfied by the government’s showing, the judge could deny the habeas corpus petition and allow the immigrant’s detention to continue. If  the immigrant’s removal was not reasonably foreseeable, the court instructed the court to grant release.</p>

    <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is required to obtain <i>valid</i> travel documents from the government of the receiving country. While immigrants are required to cooperate with ICE to whatever extent possible while they are detained, ICE is ultimately responsible for following up with consulates and embassies to ensure that the documents are valid and secured.<a href="#12" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="12-ref"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>


    <p>These processes are, in theory, designed to “ensure that individuals are deported to countries where they have recognized status,” upon arrival and to ensure compliance with foreign and international law. Travel documents to the receiving country should thus be viewed as entry documents that grant the person access to rights and services.<a href="#13" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="13-ref"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>


    <p>The Supreme Court’s ruling in <i>Zadvydas</i> recognizes the need for oversight over the process of securing travel documents, particularly when an immigrant has been held in detention for longer than six months.</p>

    <h6 id="uppercase" style="color: black;">THE COURt HAS ABDICATED ITS Constitutional RESPONSIBILITY</h6> 

    <h3 style="color: black;">as the primary protector of individual liberty in Etowah</h3> 

   
  </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6" style="padding-top:20px;">

  <p>Judges in the Northern District of Alabama have abdicated their responsibility to rigorously oversee the detention of people awaiting deportation. In Etowah, the overwhelming majority - 94.2% - of detainees who filed habeas petitions between 2010 and 2015 did not have a lawyer, only underscoring the need for meaningful engagement by the Court. The Court failed to adhere to the guidelines of the habeas corpus statute – it provided ICE with unreasonably long periods to respond to habeas corpus petitions,  summarily granted every extension sought by ICE and  never held a single evidentiary hearing.</p>  


  <p>The Court did not grant a single habeas corpus petition in the five-year period analyzed in this report. In many cases, ICE removed, transferred or released the individual from Etowah before the Court decided on the habeas corpus petition, thereby circumventing judicial oversight of detention and denying detainees’ the right to be heard before a court. In other cases, the petitions were summarily denied without any kind of hearing. The Court had numerous opportunities to fulfill its constitutional duty. In reality, however, the courts have failed to intervene - to ask questions about allegations of fraudulent removal attempts and travel documents or to resolve factual disputes as to who is the source of delay and obstruction in procuring travel documents. In failing to exercise rigorous judicial inquiry into immigrants’ habeas petitions, the Court is abdicating its constitutional responsibility: to issue guidance on the meaning of the law.  It is also leaving the immigrants who are released with no protection from detention in any of ICE’s far-flung detention centers, and requiring a new round of habeas litigation.  In this judicial vacuum,  ICE has ample opportunity to abuse its power and inflict harm on detainees - results that will be explored in depth in the following two sections.</p>

  <hr>

  <h3 id="uppercase" style="font-size: 18px; color: black">The Court has failed to comply with the habeas law</h3>

  <p>As discussed in the proceeding section, under the habeas statute (28 U.S.C. §2243), once a habeas petition has been filed, courts are required to quickly issue an order to show cause directed at the person who has custody of the petitioner.<a href="#14" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="14-ref"><sup>[6]</sup></a> Despite the fact that the statute calls for a response within three days (and sets a maximum of 23 days), in 100% of the cases filed in the last 5 years, the Court granted ICE <b>thirty days</b> to respond. This thirty-day period is longer than the maximum amount of time allowed under the habeas statute, even when the government shows good cause for an extension. Furthermore, the Court in the Northern District of Alabama granted <b>every extension</b> requested by ICE/DHS without any explanation or any acknowledgement for the added detention that the petitioner faced as a result.</p>

  <p>The Court in the Northern District of Alabama is not fulfilling its “legal responsibility to review the lawfulness of an alien’s continued detention.”<a href="#15" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="15-ref"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>


  <p>By failing to adjudicate habeas corpus petitions with the expediency required by the law, the Court prolongs the deprivation of liberty faced by detainees. Despite the broad range of factual disputes present in the hundreds of habeas petitions filed between April 30, 2010 and September 8, 2015, the Court only ordered evidentiary hearings in <b>four</b> cases.Not a single one of these hearings was actually held and thus the Court <b>did not hold a single hearing</b> during this five-year period. In failing to even schedule hearings where factual disputes could be independently investigated, the Court effectively deferred to ICE’s renditions of the facts and failed to allow people to exercise their right to appear in court to advocate for their release. Even in cases where detainees alleged that ICE was attempting to remove them with fraudulent travel documents or to countries where the detainee had never previously set foot, the Court failed to inquire further, as is their duty.</p>

 <h3 id="uppercase" style="font-size: 18px; color: black">THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA HAS FAILED TO ADHERE TO THE PROTECTIONS ESTABLISHED BY THE SUPREME COURT</h3>


<p>The Supreme Court clearly states that detention while awaiting removal becomes presumptively unreasonable after 180 days, and that courts must inquire into the “reasonable foreseeability” of a detainee’s removal after this 180-day point. The decision requires that courts imbue some substantive meaning to “reasonable foreseeability”; that they, over time, generate standards as to what circumstances lead to a detainee’s release under <i>Zadvydas</i> and what circumstances justify continued detention.</p>

<p>In the Northern District of Alabama, 89% of detainees who filed habeas petitions were detained for over 250 days after their removal order and some were detained as long as 1,122 days.  Some of these cases include concrete proof that no travel document would be forthcoming, and some involve deceit or potential fraud on the part of ICE.  Many habeas petitions filed in the NDAL were dismissed as moot without receiving any judicial review over the factual disputes between detainees and ICE. In every case that was not mooted out, the Court found that the removal of detainees was foreseeable and therefore no one should be released. In most instances, the Court simply waited for ICE to remove, transfer or temporarily release the detainee; in rare cases, they published opinions articulating their denial. In one case, where the detainee alleged that the travel documents ICE provided him were fraudulent, the Court published a rare opinion stating that “regardless of whether Mr. N’s signature on the travel document is a forgery, Mr. N fails to state a claim for relief under <i>Zadvydas</i> because he “has not provided evidence of a good reason to believe that there is no significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future.” Without any guidance from the Court as to what an adequate showing of “not reasonably foreseeable” might look like, detainees – who are filing their habeas corpus petitions without a lawyer or legal expertise - have no way of knowing whether their claims are sufficiently stated. They have no notice as to what a <i>Zadvydas</i> showing requires and now way to ensure that they are framing their claims appropriately for their release. </p> 

<p>The Supreme Court <b>explicitly</b> cautioned against courts deferring to ICE’s reasoning as truth - indeed, they equated mere acceptance of ICE’s rationale as an abdication of authority.<a href="#16" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="16-ref"><sup>[8]</sup></a> Thus in the context of what the Supreme Court demanded in 2001, the Northern District of Alabama’s behavior is a total abdication of their constitutional responsibility as the primary protector of individual liberty interests in Etowah.</p>

<div class="col-md-6" style="padding-top:0px;">


<p>Etowah County Detention Center (Etowah) has been repeatedly denounced by human rights advocates as one of the worst immigrant detention centers in the country.<a href="#17" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="17-ref"><sup>[9]</sup></a> It is an open secret that Etowah is ICE’s preferred location for warehousing immigrants subject to prolonged detention. Etowah is a strategic location for several reasons: its low cost to the federal government, its remote location within the jurisdiction of a federal district court and appeals court that are highly likely to side with the government and against detainees, and the infamously poor conditions within the jail, which lead many detainees to lose hope and give up on challenging their removal.</p>

<p>Etowah is a county jail in Gadsden, Alabama run by the Etowah County Sheriff’s Department. Gadsden is a small, economically depressed city in northeastern Alabama, located about 60 miles northeast of Birmingham and 120 miles northwest of Atlanta, the closest major urban center. Etowah County has had a contract known as an intergovernmental service agreement, or IGSA, with the federal government to house immigrant detainees in the jail since 1997.<a href="#18" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="18-ref"><sup>[10]</sup></a> ICE detainees are housed in several dedicated units within the jail. Etowah currently holds approximately 300 male<a href="#19" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="19-ref"><sup>[11]</sup></a> immigrant detainees who come from all over the U.S. and were born in countries all over the world: Cameroon, Jamaica, Ethiopia, El Salvador, Kenya, Brazil, and many more. A disproportionate share of Etowah detainees are stateless or from countries where it is incredibly difficult to deport someone due to internal strife or a lack of a repatriation treaty with the U.S. Many Etowah detainees are fighting their deportation out of fear of torture or persecution in their countries of origin.</p>

<p>For-profit, corporate-owned immigrant detention centers have garnered significant negative attention in recent years,<a href="#20" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="20-ref"><sup>[12]</sup></a> and right fully so. IGSA facilities like Etowah, however, are subject to many of the same perverse profit incentives as for-profit detention centers. Under the current contract, ICE pays the Etowah County Sheriff one of the lowest per diem rates in the country: $45 per detainee per day<a href="#21" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="21-ref"><sup>[13]</sup></a> , compared with the average national cost of $164 per day.<a href="#22" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="22-ref"><sup>[14]</sup></a> Despite this already extremely low price, advocates and detainees have routinely complained that the Sheriff cuts corners in ways that further jeopardize the basic health and safety of both detainees and ECDC personnel, for example by feeding detainees insufficient portions and rotten food, and understaffing the detention units.<a href="#23" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="23-ref"><sup>[15]</sup></a> In fact, an obscure Alabama law permits sheriffs to personally pocket the savings on such contracts.<a href="#24" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="24-ref"><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p>Etowah is located in a remote area of the country, two and a half hours from Atlanta and hundreds or thousands of miles from most detainees’ families, home communities, and legal counsel (for the few detainees that actually have counsel). This extreme isolation goes against ICE’s own policy of locating detention centers closer to metropolitan areas where detainees can access services and family visitation.<a href="#25" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="25-ref"><sup>[17]</sup></a> There is no Legal Orientation Program at Etowah, and the vast majority of detainees do not have lawyers.<a href="#26" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="26-ref"><sup>[18]</sup></a> The sense of desolation in Etowah is further exacerbated by the fact that little or no programming is available to detainees.<a href="#27" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="27-ref"><sup>[19]</sup></a> Visitation is only permitted by video monitor for a maximum of one half hour, even when loved ones travel long distances to visit detainees. There is no privacy in the video visitation area, and monitors have malfunctioned, prohibiting visitation entirely.<a href="#28" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="28-ref"><sup>[19]</sup></a> Etowah’s isolation has been a point of repeated criticism by human rights advocates, including in a searing report by the Women’s Refugee Commission (WRC).<a href="#29" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="29-ref"><sup>[20]</sup></a> A statement by the ACLU National Prison Project to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights described Etowah as “one of the most notorious examples” of detention facilities located far from detainees’ families and legal assistance.<a href="#30" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="30-ref"><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>
</div>

<p>Etowah has become emblematic of many of the most damning aspects of the United States detention and incarceration system: detainees are subject to physical violence and verbal abuse, unconstitutional prolonged and indefinite detention, highly restrictive prison-like conditions, insufficient nutrition, inadequate mental health and medical care, excessive use of solitary confinement, and lack of access to in-person visitation, outdoor recreation, meaningful programming, and—because of Etowah’s extremely remote location—family and community contact, legal orientation, representation, and social services.<a href="#31" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="31-ref"><sup>[22]</sup></a>  In light of Etowah’s record of systemic human rights violations, multiple civil society groups have called for its immediate<br> closure.<a href="#32" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="32-ref"><sup>[23]</sup></a> </p>

<p>In fact, ICE was on the brink of terminating its contract with Etowah County in 2010. But Etowah County officials and Alabama Congressional representatives, including Sen. Richard Shelby, Rep. Mike Rogers, and Rep. Robert Aderholt (chair of Homeland Security subcommittee of House Appropriations Committee) pressured ICE to delay and then abandon its plans for Etowah’s closure. ICE announced in April 2011 it would continue detaining immigrants there.<a href="#33" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="33-ref"><sup>[24]</sup></a> </p>

<p>Recently, DHS’s own internal watchdog, the Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, singled out Etowah in its annual report, noting the frequency of civil rights complaints and renewing a call for ICE to stop using the facility to house detainees.<a href="#34" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="34-ref"><sup>[25]</sup></a> Nonetheless, despite repeated complaints from detainees, human rights advocates, and even DHS itself, Etowah has passed its recent inspections with flying colors. A recent report by the National Immigrant Justice Center and Detention Watch Network on ICE’s failed inspections process highlighted Etowah as one of the most glaring examples of the disconnect between inspections ratings and the reality on the<br> ground.<a href="#35" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="35-ref"><sup>[26]</sup></a></p> 

<p>The extent of the isolation faced by detainees at Etowah cannot be understated - detainees are held far away from their families, communities and the public at large. Judges in the Northern District of Alabama are the only impartial actors who can bear witness to the plight of these detainees. What courts choose to do after habeas petitions are filed is thus of the utmost importance.</p>
