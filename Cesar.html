    <p><b>Cesar</b> arrived in the United States in November of 2012 as an asylum seeker from Eritrea. After his application for asylum was denied, he was detained by ICE. Cesar had no criminal convictions and had never served any time in prison. In Cesar’s habeas corpus petition, he contested ICE’s allegations that he was failing to comply by detailing his personal attempts to secure a travel document from the Eritrean consulate, by making phone calls and supplying ICE with all of his documents. His habeas corpus petition alleges that the Consulate informed him on April 15th, 2014 that they did not recognize him as a citizen of Eritrea, and that they would not issue a travel document. His habeas corpus petition further alleges that ICE informed him that the El Salvadorian consulate would take care of his travel documents. Cesar states clearly in his habeas corpus petition that he is obviously not from El Salvador and should not be deported to that country. Twenty-two days after Mr. Cesar filed his habeas corpus petition, the Court ordered the ICE to respond within twenty days. It did not order any specific response in relation to the allegations about ICE securing travel documents and the removal attempts to El Salvador. Nine days before a response was due, ICE requested an extension of time, which the Court granted on the same day. Sixteen days later ICE released Cesar on an order of supervision after a year and a half in detention, completely circumventing judicial review. The Court never made findings on whether or not ICE was attempting to remove Cesar to El Salvador. Cesar was denied his right to present his case in Court, remained vulnerable to re-detention at any moment and remained vulnerable to deportation to a country to which he has no connection.</p>
