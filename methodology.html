  <p>The authors of this report first analyzed the records of habeas petitions and their ensuing adjudication were first analyzed through the Public Access to Court Electronic Records system (PACER). PACER is an electronic public access service of United States federal court documents, allowing users to obtain case and docket information from the United States district courts, among others. Remotely, the authors of the report were able to view:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Lists of all parties and participants in cases, including judges and attorneys</li>

      <li>A chronology of dates of case events entered in the case record, beginning with the filing of the habeas petition and ending with the publishing of an opinion by a judge</li>

      <li>The types of documents, motions, and supplements filed by detainees, government attorneys, and judges.</li>
    </ul>

  <p>This report’s authors quickly discovered that electronic access to habeas corpus petitions filed with the Northern District of Alabama courthouse is extremely limited. From a distance, the the authors could only access the names of individuals who had filed habeas petitions and how many habeas petitions had been filed. The actual habeas petitions filed by immigrant detainees were not available for viewing, as they are considered sensitive and therefore kept confidential under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5.2(c)(2)(b).  Thus some basic information such as the petitioner’s country of origin, and the nature of their habeas claims was not accessible. In the NDAL magistrate judges (judges whose work had been delegated to them by district judges or statute) typically made recommendations on an immigrant’s habeas petition, which were then summarily adopted by the district court judge. Under FRCP 5.2(c)(2)(b) however, magistrate judges’ opinions were also considered sensitive and therefore kept confidential, and as a result could not be viewed remotely.</p>

  <p>The only way to access documents or to figure out the outcome of habeas petitions filed in the Northern District of Alabama was to travel to the courthouse in Birmingham and physically print out the documents. The report’s authors traveled to the courthouse in Birmingham and the detention center in Etowah in order to obtain physical copies of all habeas petitions filed in the past five years and to meet with detainees.   Documents were then shipped back to New York City, where they were analyzed and summarized in this report.</p>

  <p>Thanks to the accompaniment of a local immigration attorney, the authors were also able to visit several Families for Freedom members detained at Etowah. Information shared by those detainees and others has also been crucial to the shaping of this report.</p>


  <p>The authors read through the entire case files for 243 habeas petitions filed in the NDAL. Typically an individual case file consisted of a habeas petition including various exhibits, a government response to the habeas petition, a petitioner’s response to the government’s filings and either a judicial decision on the habeas petition or a motion by the government to dismiss the case as moot. These documents contained significant qualitative data that helped the authors develop a better understanding of what is actually happening with habeas petitions filed by immigrant detainees from Etowah.</p>

  <p>In addition to basic information such as name, Alien Registration Number, and the dates of various filings, data was collected on the following categories:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Whether the petitioner had an attorney;</li>
      <li>The petitioner’s country of origin and immigration status;</li>
      <li>The number of extensions of filing deadlines granted to the government;</li>
      <li>The date the petitioner was first taken into ICE custody;</li>
      <li>The number of days between each filing; </li>
      <li>The main arguments that petitioners’ raised in their habeas petitions;</li>
      <li>Whether or not the petitioner received a POCR review;</li>
      <li>Any available information on the petitioner’s travel documents </li>
      <li>Whether the petitioner was removed or released prior to the adjudication of the habeas and how much time between filing and removal or release.</li>
    </ul>

  <p>After the first round of data was analyzed, the authors grouped the cases into a series of qualitative, overlapping categories. The categories included issues like government contradictions in their filings; inadequate POCR; attempts to deport detainees with suspicious travel documents; and communications from embassies denying the issuance of travel documents.</p>
