    <p>The case of William, who arrived in the United States by boat from Jamaica in the 1990s at the age of 10, illustrates ICE’s use of failure to comply status to prolong an immigrant’s confinement. William was abandoned by his mother in Jamaica and had no other stated family.  ICE believed that William was a citizen of Trinidad and Tobago. ICE claimed that William failed to provide any identification and that his only excuse for lack of documentation was his “lack of family.” In other words, despite the fact that William came to the US by boat as a ten year old child ICE blamed him for his lack of family and for the fact that he has no proof of Trinidadian identity.  William spent a year and half in detention after receiving a final order of removal despite the fact that the Embassy of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago provided an official letter stating that they were not able to confirm William’s identity and therefore could not legally issue travel documents. When ICE could not secure a travel document for <b>William</b>, it brought criminal charges against him for failing to comply (failing to comply is a federal crime for which prison sentences can be imposed, but unlike regular FTC status, require actual criminal proceedings). At the time ICE had him charged with failing to comply, William already had a letter in his possession from the Embassy of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago stating: <i>“After exhaustive searches of the records held at the Immigration Division, Ministry of National Security, and the Register of Births and Deaths of the Registrar General’s Department, no record was found pertaining to the birth of William, born on July 5th, 1965 in Trinidad and Tobago neither was there any record of the issue of any travel document to anyone holding that biometric information…it will not be possible to issue a travel document in his favour.”</i> Although ICE clearly had this information, they continued to detain William and actually filed criminal charges against William in January 2012 for failing to comply. This charge was dismissed by the District Court of New Mexico in May 2012. Despite this dismissal and a letter from the Embassy of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago denying the issuance of travel documents, ICE detained William for another five months, until he filed a habeas corpus petition. When William finally signaled his unlawful detention to the Court in the Northern District of Alabama, ICE released William on an order of supervision.  There was no judicial scrutiny over ICE’s behavior in this case and William remains vulnerable to re-detention.</p>
